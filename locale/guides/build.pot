The script will download ``iroha-docker-develop`` and ``postgres`` images. ``iroha-docker-develop`` image contains all development dependencies and is based on top of ``ubuntu:16.04``. ``postgres`` image is required for starting and running Iroha. 3. Two containers are created and launched. 4. The user is attached to the interactive environment for development and testing with ``iroha`` folder mounted from the host machine. Iroha folder is mounted to ``/opt/iroha`` in Docker container."
