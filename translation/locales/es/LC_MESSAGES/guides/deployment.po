"Hyperledger Iroha can be deployed in different ways, depending on the "
"perspective and the purpose. There can be either a single node deployed, "
"or multiple nodes running in several containers on a local machine or "
"spread across the network — so pick any case you need. This page "
"describes different scenarios and is intended to act as a how-to guide "
