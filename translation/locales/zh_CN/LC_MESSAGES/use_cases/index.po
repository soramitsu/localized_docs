"Hyperledger Iroha incorporates into the system multiple certifying "
"authorities such as universities, schools, and medical institutions. "
"Flexible permission model used in Hyperledger Iroha allows building "
"certifying identities, and grant certificates. The storage of explicit "

"Imagine a medical institution registered as a ``hospital`` domain in "
"Hyperledger Iroha. This domain has certified and registered workers each "
"having some role, e.g. ``physician``, ``therapist``, ``nurse``. Each "
"patient of the hospital has an account with full medical history. Each "
"medical record, like blood test results, is securely and privately stored"
" in the account of the patient as JSON key/values. Rules in ``hospital`` "
"domain are defined such that only certified medical workers and the user "
"can access the personal information. The medical data returned by a query"
" is verified that it comes from a trusted source."

"Hospital is tied to a specific location, following legal rules of that "
"location, like storing personal data of citizens only in specific "
"regions(`privacy rules`_). A multi-domain approach in Hyperledger Iroha "
"allows sharing information across multiple countries not violating legal "
"rules. For example, if the user ``makoto@hospital`` decides to share "
"personal case history with a medical institution in another country, the "
"user can use ``grant`` command with permission ``can_get_my_acc_detail``."

"Similar to a medical institution, a registered university in Hyperledger "
"Iroha has permissions to push information to the graduated students. A "

"Hyperledger Iroha provides fast and clear trade and settlement rules "

"For example [#f1]_, a user might want to transfer the ownership of a car."
" User ``haruto`` has registered owner-asset relationship with a car of "
"``sora`` brand with parameters: ``{\"id\": "
"\"34322069732074686520616E73776572\", \"color\": \"red\", \"size\": "
"\"small\"}``. This ownership is fixed in an underlying database of the "
"system with copies at each validating peer. To perform the transfer "
"operation user ``haruto`` creates an offer, i.e. a multi-signature "
"transaction with two commands: ``transfer`` to user ``haru`` the car "
"identifier and ``transfer`` some amount of ``usd`` tokens from ``haru`` "
"to ``haruto``. Upon receiving the offer ``haru`` accepts it by signing "
"the multi-signature transaction, in this case, transaction atomically "
"commits to the system."

"Hyperleger Iroha can be very useful in the auditing process. Each "
"information is validated by business rules and is constantly maintained "
"by distinct network participants. Access control rules along with some "
"encryption maintain desired level of privacy. Access control rules can be"
" defined at different levels: user-level, domain-level or system-level. "
"At the user-level privacy rules for a specific individual are defined. If"
" access rules are determined at domain or system level, they are "
"affecting all users in the domain. In Hyperledger Iroha we provide "
"convenient role-based access control rules, where each role has specific "
"permissions."

"Transactions can be traced with a local database. Using Iroha-API auditor"
" can query and perform analytics on the data, execute specific audit "
"software. Hyperledger Iroha supports different scenarios for deploying "
"analytics software:  on a local computer, or execute code on specific "
"middleware. This approach allows analyzing Big Data application with "
"Hadoop, Apache, and others. Hypeledger Iroha serves as a guarantor of "
"data integrity and privacy (due to the query permissions restriction)."

"For example, auditing can be helpful in financial applications. An "
"auditor account has a role of the ``auditor`` with permissions to access "
"the information of users in the domain without bothering the user. To "
"reduce the probability of account hijacking and prevent the auditor from "
"sending malicious queries, the auditor is typically defined as a multi-"
"signature account, meaning that auditor can make queries only having "
"signatures from multiple separate identities. The auditor can make "
"queries not only to fetch account data and balance but also all "
"transactions of a user, e.g. all transfers of user ``haruto`` in domain "
"``konoha``. To efficiently analyze data of million users each Iroha node "
"can work in tandem with analytics software."

"Multi-signature transactions are a powerful tool of Hyperledger Iroha "
"that can disrupt tax system. Each transaction in a certain domain can be "
"as a multi-signature transaction, where one signature comes from the user"
" (for example asset transfer) and the second signature comes from special"
" taxing nodes. Taxing nodes will have special validation rules written "
"using Iroha-API, e.g. each purchase in the certified stores must pay "
"taxes. In other words, Iroha a valid purchase transaction must contain "
"two commands: money transfer(purchase) to the store and money "
"transfer(tax payment) to the government."

"Hyperledger Iroha has an intrinsic support for identity management. Each "
"user in the system has a uniquely identified account with personal "
"information, and each transaction is signed and associated with a certain"
" user. This makes Hyperledger Iroha perfect for various application with "
"KYC (Know Your Customer) features."

"For example, insurance companies can benefit from querying the "
"information of user’s transaction without worrying about the information "
"truthfulness. Users can also benefit from storing personal information on"
" a blockchain since authenticated information will reduce the time of "
"claims processing. Imagine a situation where a user wants to make a hard "
"money loan. Currently, pre-qualification is a tedious process of "
"gathering information about income, debts and information verification. "
"Each user in Hyperledger Iroha has an account with verified personal "
"information, such as owning assets, job positions, and debts. User income"
" and debts can be traced using query ``GetAccountTransactions``, owning "
"assets using query ``GetAccountAssets`` and job positions using "
"``GetAccountDetail``. Each query returns verified result reducing the "
"processing time of hard money loan will take only a few seconds. To "
"incentivize users to share personal information, various companies can "
"come up with business processes. For example, insurance companies can "
"create bonus discounts for users making fitness activities. Fitness "
"applications can push private Proof-of-Activity to the system, and the "
"user can decide later to share information with insurance companies using"
" ``GrantPermission`` with permission ``can_get_my_acc_detail``."

"Food supply chain is a shared system with multiple different actors, such"

"deliver food from a farmer's field to the table of a customer. The "
"product goes through many stages, with each stage recorded in shared "
"space. A customer scans a code of the product via a mobile device, in "
"which an Iroha query is encoded. Iroha query provides a full history with"
